# Corridor Simulation

> **_NOTE:_**  For the Python version dedicated for simulating the Guangzhou BRT, please visit "https://github.com/Minyu-Shen/GBRT_Simulation". 

This repository contains the simulation program for a manuscipt titled "Bus Holding Strtegies for Busy Bus Corridor", which was previously under review. The simulation logic is implemented by C++; you can use the makefile to compile. After the compilation, you can call the python script (i.e., run_exp.py) to run the experiments and reproduce the results presented in the paper.

In addition, we also create a very simple animation for checking the potential simulation logic errors using Javascript. It is directly included in the HTML file (i.e., animation.html).

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know via <myshen1991@gmail.com>.
